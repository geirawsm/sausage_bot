# SausageBot

SausageBot - affectionately known as "p√∏lsa" among its Norwegian users - is a Discord bot with some very specific functions.

## Usage

This code is intended to be selfhosted and run on a server you have access to.

## Installation

Ok, so you want to run a Discord bot?

### Register Discord bot
Read up on what you need to do to register a bot on Discord: https://discord.com/developers/docs/getting-started

### .env file
The .env file is essential to the bot. It contains all the important information that the bot uses, both for connecting to Discord and setting the correct stats channel, setting a custom "watching" info for the bot, and adding your API key if you want to use the Youtube-cog.
The first time running the script, it will fail, but it will also create a template .env file for you in the root folder.

### Actually running the bot
It is recommended to run the bot in a controlled environment, by using pipenv or similar services.
The bot is ran by the command `python -m sausage_bot` (or any other name you want to give the root folder).

If you run `python -m sausage_bot -h` you can also see all the arguments you can add.
