When I first came across the Swedish group in late 2017 via their debut, <em>The End is Nigh</em>, our connection was instant—doom metal and folk metal fused together under a medieval lens, boasting lyrics that suggested a genuine effort for historical accuracy. <em>The End is Nigh</em> still makes the strongest claim of any album I&#8217;ve heard for the tag of &#8220;medieval metal,&#8221; and is one of my favorite doom metal albums. I&#8217;ve waited patiently for nearly eight years, and, finally, <strong>Apocalypse Orchestra<em> </em></strong>are releasing their sophomore full-length, <em>A Plague upon Thee</em>, in which they continue their carefully treaded way down the dismal course of medieval European history.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you&#8217;re not familiar with <strong>Apocalypse Orchestra</strong>, here&#8217;s a crash course on their sound. Jonas Lindh (Guitars), Andreas Skoglund (drums), and Rikard Jansson (bass) play mid-paced, somewhat progressive doom meta, similar to <strong>King Goat</strong>; strong riffs, great ebb and flow, and active play. Then, Mikael Lindström gets involved, adding hurdy gurdy, bagpipes, and mandola, both in lead and supporting capacities, and as primary drivers of melody. The folk instruments add a rustic filter, which is complemented by Erik Larsson (more guitars, more mandola, lute, cittern, vocals), whose singing style is something I can&#8217;t quite put into words—his baritone fits the &#8220;medieval&#8221; theme of <em>A Plague upon Thee</em> with unique grace. His growls are very strong, but used sparsely. All five band members also contribute backing vocals, to phenomenal effect, giving the album an epic undertone. Of course, there&#8217;s no keyboard;<sup class='footnote'><a href='https://www.angrymetalguy.com/apocalypse-orchestra-a-plague-upon-thee-review/#fn-212458-1' id='fnref-212458-1' onclick='return fdfootnote_show(212458)'>1</a></sup> anywhere one could conceivably be used, the choir shows up instead. Put all of this together, and <strong>Apocalypse Orchestra</strong> have claim to a unique sound, one they&#8217;ve clearly been honing for years.</p>
<p><iframe class="aligncenter" style="border: 0; width: 500px; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1016965102/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless=""><a href="https://apocalypseorchestra.bandcamp.com/album/a-plague-upon-thee"><em>A Plague upon Thee</em> by <strong>Apocalypse Orchestra</strong></a></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With so many instruments and so much history to work from, <em>A Plague upon Thee</em> does not lack for ideas. &#8220;Glass and Sun&#8221; tackles religious dominance in the era, letting the bagpipes lead in a stunning display to mirror the worship common from the time. &#8220;Tempest&#8221; takes its inspiration from Revelations; it is the darkest song on the album and one of its best. Never has a hurdy-gurdy—or Larsson, for that matter—sounded so commanding. This is one of few songs that make use of his cruel growls in a thematically welcome turn, and also one of the few to feature a guitar solo. &#8220;Anchorhold&#8221; is a mid-paced folk-doom march with a huge chorus that tells the story of a dispirited anchorite. The mournful hurdy-gurdy leads echo their frustration and despair, supported by huge riffs crashing through with modern rage. <strong>Apocalypse Orchestra</strong> also excel in smaller, subtler moments; the choral melody in &#8220;Virago&#8221; is so quiet but so effective; similarly, the mandolin in &#8220;From the Athanor&#8221; is easy to miss, but the verses would be notably different without it. At every turn—musically, lyrically, and thematically—there is careful thought and clear intent throughout <em>A Plague upon Thee</em>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-212460 size-large" src="https://www.angrymetalguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/apocalypse-orchestra-a-plague-upon-thee-02-500x333.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="333" srcset="https://www.angrymetalguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/apocalypse-orchestra-a-plague-upon-thee-02-500x333.jpg 500w, https://www.angrymetalguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/apocalypse-orchestra-a-plague-upon-thee-02-350x233.jpg 350w, https://www.angrymetalguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/apocalypse-orchestra-a-plague-upon-thee-02-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.angrymetalguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/apocalypse-orchestra-a-plague-upon-thee-02-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.angrymetalguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/apocalypse-orchestra-a-plague-upon-thee-02.jpg 1928w" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 250px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For all that <strong>Apocalypse Orchestra</strong> does differently than most bands, there are still hallmarks of doom metal alongside their creativity. With the exception of &#8220;To Arrive&#8221; (a powerful interlude), every song falls between seven and nine minutes long, giving the eight-song album a runtime of just under an hour. As mentioned earlier, <strong>Apocalypse Orchestra</strong>, and especially Mikael Lindström, know how to keep things interesting, but if there is one critique I can make for <em>A Plague upon Thee</em>, it is that there is a clear formula at work. The band excels with huge choruses, supported by choral vocals; each song has a distinct lead from the hurdy-gurdy or bagpipes; and each song is roughly the same length with a similar design. This is not to say that every song sounds the same—not even close—but most of the excitement happens within a similar formula. More variety in the formula itself might endear <em>A Plague upon Thee</em> to a wider audience because the music itself is nothing short of great.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To some extent, the &#8220;medieval metal&#8221; tag has always been vague—what constitutes medieval influence anyway? But what <strong>Apocalypse Orchestra</strong> is doing is a clear attempt at genuine authenticity in colliding these two opposing worlds. In this sense, <em>A Plague upon Thee</em> is a triumph. It effortlessly blends folk music, medieval instruments, and modern metal into a captivating whole. I do hope to hear more before another eight years pass—but this will keep me happy if they do.</p>

Texas-based <strong>Warlung</strong> boast a spectacular name and though <em>The Poison Touch</em> is their 5th album, they&#8217;ve managed to evade my metal detector until now. Their sound is a mix of 70s rock, stoner doom, and occult metal with flashes of NWoBHM-inspired rowdiness sprinkled throughout. It&#8217;s highly riff-centric and the band has a certain carefree charm and likeablity factor. Over the course of <em>The Poison Touch</em>, you&#8217;ll be reminded of acts like <strong>Ghost</strong>, <strong>Doctor Smoke</strong>, <strong>Uncle Acid and the Deadbeats</strong>, and of course, <strong>Black Sabbath</strong>. That&#8217;s not the worst recipe to work from and the band has chops. That should be enough to keep you breathing, right?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Warlung</strong> coughs up a solid first impression on opener &#8220;Digital Smoke&#8221; which is a raucous, groovy rocker that reminds me equally of <strong>Cauldron</strong> and <strong>Doctor Smoke</strong>. It&#8217;s catchy as fook and easy to like with meaty riffs churning away as George Baba and Phillip Bennet swap vocal lines. One of them (I&#8217;m not sure which) sounds a lot like <strong>Doctor Smoke</strong>&#8217;s Matt Tluchowski and his nasally delivery is upbeat and pleasant. This one got stuck in my brain on the first spin and I can&#8217;t seem to dislodge the smoke. &#8220;White Light Seeker&#8221; delivers a lead riff that sounds like it was &#8220;borrowed&#8221; from <em>Sabbath Bloody Sabbath</em> and the song delivers hooky, groovy retro rock with a strong 70s doom edge. It&#8217;s an instant winner that sticks like Alien Tape™. Album set piece &#8220;Spell Speaker&#8221; is a nearly 9-minute odyssey that starts life sounding <em>a lot</em> like <strong>Iron Butterfly</strong>&#8217;s immortal classic &#8220;In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida&#8221; before drifting into lazy hazy 70s hard rock and veering into <strong>Sabbath</strong> and <strong>Ghost</strong> territories. It&#8217;s a sprawling, unhurried saga that takes as much time as it wants to set the mood, with side quests into trippy guitar noodling. Surprisingly, it all works very well and the minutes fly by before you realize it. A very cool tune.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The back half of <em>The Poison Touch</em> is less adventurous, opting for more direct stoner rock attacks, but they generally hit pay dirt. &#8220;Holy Guide&#8221; reminds of <strong>Freedom Hawk</strong> and <strong>Uncle Acid</strong>, and closer &#8220;29th Scroll, 6th Verse&#8221; goes hard on the same kind of fuzzy bounce and groove <strong>Uncle Acid</strong> made their name with. The band&#8217;s agile songcraft makes things entertaining and memorable and they bring real chops to the execution, especially in the fretboard department. While no track feels completely unworthy, short interlude &#8220;Mourning Devils&#8221; doesn&#8217;t add much, and &#8220;Rat Bastard&#8221; is a bit too goofy, though the riffs are there in abundance. At a trim 36 minutes, the album flows past in a flash,  and even &#8220;Spell Speaker&#8221; doesn&#8217;t interrupt the rocking momentum.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-212373 aligncenter" src="https://www.angrymetalguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Warlung_The-Poison-Touch-02-500x375.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" srcset="https://www.angrymetalguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Warlung_The-Poison-Touch-02-500x375.jpg 500w, https://www.angrymetalguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Warlung_The-Poison-Touch-02-350x263.jpg 350w, https://www.angrymetalguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Warlung_The-Poison-Touch-02-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.angrymetalguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Warlung_The-Poison-Touch-02.jpg 800w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 48em) 100vw, 250px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Baba and Bennett share axe work as well as vocal duties and they do a fine job on both fronts. The guitar tandem loads the material with sharp riffs of various eras and styles and it&#8217;s a pleasure to hear them playing off one another as they move from hard-charging riffs to 70s psych rock, doom, and bong-fueled noodle sessions. They borrow from all the right sources and keep things interesting most of the time. The vocals are good too, vibrant and quirky, sometimes sounding a lot like Papa Emeritus. There&#8217;s a playfulness to them that works well with the music and throughout the album Baba and Bennett remind me of roughly 10 other stoner and doom vocalists, so variety is not an issue here.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Warlung</strong> bring a sense of joy and just enough inventiveness to the stoner/retro rock genre to make a lasting impression and what they do on <em>The Poison Touch</em> is mighty tough to dislike. It&#8217;s the kind of album that grows on you with every spin and there are some slick, killer tunes camping out here. I almost gave it a higher score and I&#8217;m enjoying it enough to start examining their back catalog, so they&#8217;re doing something right. If you need a fun, mindless palate cleanser of an album that pairs well with beers, buds, and other buds, catch yourself a nasty case of <strong>Warlung</strong>. Cough, cough, cough, cough DA-DA, DA-DA-DA!</p>

Boasting a nasty streak and series of ginormous grooves and infectiously hooky riffs and songwriting, the album had a fresh appeal, featuring nods towards legendary acts, <strong>Motörhead</strong> and<strong> Melvins.</strong> An equally impressive sophomore album followed, solidifying <strong>Mantar</strong> as a dependable force as their career progressed. Despite recent efforts not quite hitting the impressive highs of their early work,  <strong>Mantar</strong> remain true to the old &#8216;if it ain&#8217;t broke don&#8217;t fix it&#8217; motto to solid effect. Returning with a fifth album of original material, can <em>Post Apocalyptic Depression</em> find <strong>Mantar</strong> raising the takes to return to the intense highs of their early work, or will they fall victim to the dreaded <em>Law of Diminishing</em> returns?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Mantar</strong>&#8217;s signature sound remains distinctive and easy to like. The duo&#8217;s more refined songwriting and polished modern production may have slightly compromised the nastier edge and rawer traits that proved so effective on <em>Death By Burning</em> and <em>Ode to the Flame</em>, however, the duo&#8217;s sound has certainly not lost its edge.  Each song packs revved-up energy, punky attitude, and ample heft to get the blood pumping and the head bobbing in unison with <strong>Mantar</strong>&#8217;s groovy swagger and penchant for burly, surly riffs and hooky songcraft. In this respect <strong>Mantar</strong> treads similar terrain to their past couple of albums, pumping out compact, energetic ditties at a lively clip. Whereas the first couple of albums featured a darker, brooding menace and venomous edge, <em>Post Apocalyptic Depression</em> leans into the hard-hitting rock grooves and straightforward songwriting to warm, comforting, if less potent effect.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The raucous delivery and no-frills blueprint pay dividends for the most part, making for a punchy, compact listen. While mostly sticking to his trademark raspy snarl, Hanno&#8217;s endearing vocals possess a wickedly infectious knack for sing-along vocal hooks and accessibility that belies the seething elements and blackened touches that still frame the <strong>Mantar</strong> sound. It&#8217;s especially cool when he layers things up with a cleaner, punky snarl to offset his signature rasp. A quick burst of feedback kicks off opener &#8220;Absolute Ghost,&#8221; leading headlong into a thumping beat and typically groovy punk-sludge riff. It&#8217;s a brisk, impactful beginning, setting the tone for what follows. Amidst nods to their punkier old school roots, <em>Post Apocalyptic Depression </em>doesn&#8217;t bust boundaries or challenge the duo&#8217;s best work. However, it proves a heavier and slightly less polished affair than its predecessor, with a thin layer of grime to dirty up otherwise sleek modern production values.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-212268 size-large" src="https://www.angrymetalguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Mantar-PostApocalypticDepression02-500x333.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="333" srcset="https://www.angrymetalguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Mantar-PostApocalypticDepression02-500x333.jpg 500w, https://www.angrymetalguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Mantar-PostApocalypticDepression02-350x233.jpg 350w, https://www.angrymetalguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Mantar-PostApocalypticDepression02-768x511.jpg 768w, https://www.angrymetalguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Mantar-PostApocalypticDepression02-1536x1022.jpg 1536w, https://www.angrymetalguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Mantar-PostApocalypticDepression02-2048x1363.jpg 2048w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 48em) 100vw, 250px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Running at a tight 35 minutes, quality mostly strikes a consistent standard. A handful of decent but less remarkable tunes (&#8220;Morbid Vocation,&#8221; &#8220;Principle of Command&#8221; and &#8220;Two Choices of Eternity&#8221;) sit alongside more memorable counterparts, including super catchy single &#8220;Rex Perverso,&#8221; and the more ambitious, seething throes of blackened sludge brawler, &#8220;Halsgericht.&#8221; Pacing occasionally stutters but never derails momentum thanks to other cut-above gems, such as the vicious punk tones and anthemic hooks of the excellent &#8220;Dogma Down,&#8221; and walloping one-two punch of &#8220;Pit of Guilt&#8221; and dubiously titled &#8220;Church of Suck.&#8221;  Later in the piece, listeners will be pleased by the uglier, genuinely blackened intensity of the rabid &#8220;Axe Death Scenario.&#8221; Hanno&#8217;s solid guitar work and punk-charged sludgy riffs still carry plenty of bite and heft. Melodic undertones and groovy textures provide some extra versatility and nuance to otherwise straight-ahead jams, further driven by Erinc&#8217;s powerhouse, no-nonsense rhythms and hard-hitting style. Production is less glossy than its predecessor but again lacks the unrefined sonic charms of their earlier material, further dulled by compressed mastering.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Over a decade removed from their punishing debut, <strong>Mantar</strong> continue delivering the dependable goods. And at this point, it&#8217;s hard to imagine them dropping a dud album anytime soon. All the key ingredients remain, the writing is as catchy as ever, and while impact may not match the might of their early work, the duo retains their fun, rollicking yet uncompromising style and infectious songcraft. On the flipside, things are getting a little too predictable over the past few albums, with the weaker, or stock standard tunes scattered amidst some genuinely top-shelf anthems compromising overall quality. Mileage will vary, but <strong>Mantar</strong>&#8217;s <em>Post Apocalyptic Depression</em> is another worthy and entertaining addition to the <strong>Mantar</strong> canon.</p>

I don&#8217;t have a horse in the &#8220;for better or worse&#8221; race, but any thrash, newe or olde, hits hard when it strikes true. A big part of that impact comes from the spirit of thrash at its core. An inherent political lean and a pointed, punk energy defines much of what makes thrash thrash—to oversimplify the scene—and also makes up a significant portion of its appeal. For Edinburgh&#8217;s <strong>Black Talon</strong>, that spirit thrives and that appeal remains intact, despite ten long years separating their upcoming <em>Scenes of Agony</em> from their unsung debut, <a href="https://blacktalonthrash.bandcamp.com/album/endless-realities" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Endless Realities</em></a>. With such a lengthy turnaround between albums, I&#8217;m interested to hear what <strong>Black Talon</strong> have to say in 2025.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you&#8217;ve heard <a href="https://www.angrymetalguy.com/havok-v-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Havok</strong></a> and <a href="https://www.angrymetalguy.com/municipal-waste-slime-and-punishment-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Municipal Waste</strong></a>, you possess a decent frame of reference for <strong>Black Talon</strong>&#8217;s sound. Throw in the particularly energetic wiles of <a href="https://www.angrymetalguy.com/death-angel-humanicide-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Death Angel</strong></a> and their ilk, and a greater sense of familiarity with this material manifests. Politics and current events remain <strong>Black Talon</strong>&#8217;s subject of choice. To that end, earnest, if wholly unsubtle, lyrics deliver their message of frustration and disdain for various modern-age issues sneering from Johnny Steele&#8217;s versatile and venomous throat. Guitarist Rory Strachan stuffs an intimidating number of high-octane riffs, pulling from all corners of the thrashverse, into these forty-seven minutes, while drummer Dave Taylor pummels D-beats, freakouts, and double-bass runs—among other neat tricks—with wild abandon. Plucky and audible, bassist Eddie Campbell allots a delightful measure of low-end bounce to <em>Scenes of Agony</em>, giving the record a fuller heft than many modern records of this ilk can claim.</p>
<p><iframe class="aligncenter" style="border: 0; width: 500px; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2122509592/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless=""><a href="https://blacktalonthrash.bandcamp.com/album/scenes-of-agony"><em>Scenes of Agony</em> by <strong>Black Talon</strong></a></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The style they play may be well-worn and reliable, but <strong>Black Talon</strong>&#8217;s execution on <em>Scenes of Agony</em> is rock-solid and at least a cut above stock. No matter where you look, a ridiculously effective hook lurks right around the corner. One of my favorite examples, &#8220;Falsifier&#8221; offers choice vocal nuggets such as &#8220;STAGES OF DENIAL AT YOUR DISCRETION,&#8221; bouncy riffing and a deeply satisfying double bass run to seal the song permanently inside my hippocampus. Quick and vicious cuts &#8220;Scenes of Agony,&#8221; &#8220;Cryptocracy,&#8221; and &#8220;Killing Time&#8221; offer similar sticky moments that make it easy to pick them out of a lineup without checking the tracklist. Unexpectedly, long-form troublemakers &#8220;Isolation&#8221; and &#8220;The Bastard Gene&#8221; also stand out as highlights by virtue of sheer vivacity. Even factoring in their somewhat lengthy buildups, these songs shrink before my ears so radically that I would never guess &#8220;Isolation&#8221; ran over nine minutes and &#8220;The Bastard Gene&#8221; barely under eight. To achieve this result, these numbers exhibit strong motifs of similar sharpness to their leaner companions, a high level of instrumental detail, and dynamic momentum.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-210536 aligncenter" src="https://www.angrymetalguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/BlackTalon_ScenesOfAgony_02-500x334.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="334" srcset="https://www.angrymetalguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/BlackTalon_ScenesOfAgony_02-500x334.jpg 500w, https://www.angrymetalguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/BlackTalon_ScenesOfAgony_02-350x234.jpg 350w, https://www.angrymetalguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/BlackTalon_ScenesOfAgony_02-768x513.jpg 768w, https://www.angrymetalguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/BlackTalon_ScenesOfAgony_02-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://www.angrymetalguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/BlackTalon_ScenesOfAgony_02.jpg 2048w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 48em) 100vw, 250px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Meanwhile, other sections of <em>Scenes of Agony</em> struggle to clear the high bar <strong>Black Talon</strong> set with their strongest material. Obviously, ten years of marinating time permitted even these cuts to make some marks, but offerings such as &#8220;Obnoxion&#8221; and closer &#8220;Not Meant to Last&#8221; don&#8217;t have the same staying power as others. In the former example, I struggle to grasp what the underlying message its lyrics mean to express. While it might be just a comprehension failure on my part (very likely), this confusion takes me out of the musical experience, as does the disorienting rapid fade that rudely shuts the number down. &#8220;Not Meant to Last,&#8221; on the flipside, simply lacks strong characteristics to magnify its voice in the greater crowd of engaging material preceding it, save for a very nice guitar solo. As a result, it sends <em>Scenes of Agony</em> off on a weaker note than it deserved. As an additional note, while I appreciate <strong>Black Talon</strong>&#8217;s focus on excellent riffcraft and muscular songwriting, developing fiery solo work, like that on &#8220;The Bastard Gene&#8221; and &#8220;Not Meant to Last,&#8221; into a few more nooks and crannies might&#8217;ve offered complementary points interest to an already compelling work.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It bears mentioning that <em>Scenes of Agony</em> sounds great regardless of its songwriting strengths and weaknesses. Full tones, rich textures, and a nice balance between instruments with Johnny&#8217;s vocals placed appropriately in front, this production strikes the right chord with this sponge. In effect, that&#8217;s what pushes <em>Scenes of Agony</em> past Good and into Very Good territory. It&#8217;s clear <strong>Black Talon</strong> loved making this record, and that care and passion for the craft comes through in the final product. A couple of nicks here and there aren&#8217;t nearly enough to dull the ear-catching luster of what might be one of the better modern thrash records to come out this year. Only time will tell!</p>
