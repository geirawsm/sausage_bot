When I first came across the Swedish group in late 2017 via their debut, <em>The End is Nigh</em>, our connection was instant—doom metal and folk metal fused together under a medieval lens, boasting lyrics that suggested a genuine effort for historical accuracy. <em>The End is Nigh</em> still makes the strongest claim of any album I&#8217;ve heard for the tag of &#8220;medieval metal,&#8221; and is one of my favorite doom metal albums. I&#8217;ve waited patiently for nearly eight years, and, finally, <strong>Apocalypse Orchestra<em> </em></strong>are releasing their sophomore full-length, <em>A Plague upon Thee</em>, in which they continue their carefully treaded way down the dismal course of medieval European history.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you&#8217;re not familiar with <strong>Apocalypse Orchestra</strong>, here&#8217;s a crash course on their sound. Jonas Lindh (Guitars), Andreas Skoglund (drums), and Rikard Jansson (bass) play mid-paced, somewhat progressive doom meta, similar to <strong>King Goat</strong>; strong riffs, great ebb and flow, and active play. Then, Mikael Lindström gets involved, adding hurdy gurdy, bagpipes, and mandola, both in lead and supporting capacities, and as primary drivers of melody. The folk instruments add a rustic filter, which is complemented by Erik Larsson (more guitars, more mandola, lute, cittern, vocals), whose singing style is something I can&#8217;t quite put into words—his baritone fits the &#8220;medieval&#8221; theme of <em>A Plague upon Thee</em> with unique grace. His growls are very strong, but used sparsely. All five band members also contribute backing vocals, to phenomenal effect, giving the album an epic undertone. Of course, there&#8217;s no keyboard;<sup class='footnote'><a href='https://www.angrymetalguy.com/apocalypse-orchestra-a-plague-upon-thee-review/#fn-212458-1' id='fnref-212458-1' onclick='return fdfootnote_show(212458)'>1</a></sup> anywhere one could conceivably be used, the choir shows up instead. Put all of this together, and <strong>Apocalypse Orchestra</strong> have claim to a unique sound, one they&#8217;ve clearly been honing for years.</p>
<p><iframe class="aligncenter" style="border: 0; width: 500px; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1016965102/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless=""><a href="https://apocalypseorchestra.bandcamp.com/album/a-plague-upon-thee"><em>A Plague upon Thee</em> by <strong>Apocalypse Orchestra</strong></a></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With so many instruments and so much history to work from, <em>A Plague upon Thee</em> does not lack for ideas. &#8220;Glass and Sun&#8221; tackles religious dominance in the era, letting the bagpipes lead in a stunning display to mirror the worship common from the time. &#8220;Tempest&#8221; takes its inspiration from Revelations; it is the darkest song on the album and one of its best. Never has a hurdy-gurdy—or Larsson, for that matter—sounded so commanding. This is one of few songs that make use of his cruel growls in a thematically welcome turn, and also one of the few to feature a guitar solo. &#8220;Anchorhold&#8221; is a mid-paced folk-doom march with a huge chorus that tells the story of a dispirited anchorite. The mournful hurdy-gurdy leads echo their frustration and despair, supported by huge riffs crashing through with modern rage. <strong>Apocalypse Orchestra</strong> also excel in smaller, subtler moments; the choral melody in &#8220;Virago&#8221; is so quiet but so effective; similarly, the mandolin in &#8220;From the Athanor&#8221; is easy to miss, but the verses would be notably different without it. At every turn—musically, lyrically, and thematically—there is careful thought and clear intent throughout <em>A Plague upon Thee</em>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-212460 size-large" src="https://www.angrymetalguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/apocalypse-orchestra-a-plague-upon-thee-02-500x333.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="333" srcset="https://www.angrymetalguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/apocalypse-orchestra-a-plague-upon-thee-02-500x333.jpg 500w, https://www.angrymetalguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/apocalypse-orchestra-a-plague-upon-thee-02-350x233.jpg 350w, https://www.angrymetalguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/apocalypse-orchestra-a-plague-upon-thee-02-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.angrymetalguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/apocalypse-orchestra-a-plague-upon-thee-02-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.angrymetalguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/apocalypse-orchestra-a-plague-upon-thee-02.jpg 1928w" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 250px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For all that <strong>Apocalypse Orchestra</strong> does differently than most bands, there are still hallmarks of doom metal alongside their creativity. With the exception of &#8220;To Arrive&#8221; (a powerful interlude), every song falls between seven and nine minutes long, giving the eight-song album a runtime of just under an hour. As mentioned earlier, <strong>Apocalypse Orchestra</strong>, and especially Mikael Lindström, know how to keep things interesting, but if there is one critique I can make for <em>A Plague upon Thee</em>, it is that there is a clear formula at work. The band excels with huge choruses, supported by choral vocals; each song has a distinct lead from the hurdy-gurdy or bagpipes; and each song is roughly the same length with a similar design. This is not to say that every song sounds the same—not even close—but most of the excitement happens within a similar formula. More variety in the formula itself might endear <em>A Plague upon Thee</em> to a wider audience because the music itself is nothing short of great.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To some extent, the &#8220;medieval metal&#8221; tag has always been vague—what constitutes medieval influence anyway? But what <strong>Apocalypse Orchestra</strong> is doing is a clear attempt at genuine authenticity in colliding these two opposing worlds. In this sense, <em>A Plague upon Thee</em> is a triumph. It effortlessly blends folk music, medieval instruments, and modern metal into a captivating whole. I do hope to hear more before another eight years pass—but this will keep me happy if they do.</p>

Texas-based <strong>Warlung</strong> boast a spectacular name and though <em>The Poison Touch</em> is their 5th album, they&#8217;ve managed to evade my metal detector until now. Their sound is a mix of 70s rock, stoner doom, and occult metal with flashes of NWoBHM-inspired rowdiness sprinkled throughout. It&#8217;s highly riff-centric and the band has a certain carefree charm and likeablity factor. Over the course of <em>The Poison Touch</em>, you&#8217;ll be reminded of acts like <strong>Ghost</strong>, <strong>Doctor Smoke</strong>, <strong>Uncle Acid and the Deadbeats</strong>, and of course, <strong>Black Sabbath</strong>. That&#8217;s not the worst recipe to work from and the band has chops. That should be enough to keep you breathing, right?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Warlung</strong> coughs up a solid first impression on opener &#8220;Digital Smoke&#8221; which is a raucous, groovy rocker that reminds me equally of <strong>Cauldron</strong> and <strong>Doctor Smoke</strong>. It&#8217;s catchy as fook and easy to like with meaty riffs churning away as George Baba and Phillip Bennet swap vocal lines. One of them (I&#8217;m not sure which) sounds a lot like <strong>Doctor Smoke</strong>&#8217;s Matt Tluchowski and his nasally delivery is upbeat and pleasant. This one got stuck in my brain on the first spin and I can&#8217;t seem to dislodge the smoke. &#8220;White Light Seeker&#8221; delivers a lead riff that sounds like it was &#8220;borrowed&#8221; from <em>Sabbath Bloody Sabbath</em> and the song delivers hooky, groovy retro rock with a strong 70s doom edge. It&#8217;s an instant winner that sticks like Alien Tape™. Album set piece &#8220;Spell Speaker&#8221; is a nearly 9-minute odyssey that starts life sounding <em>a lot</em> like <strong>Iron Butterfly</strong>&#8217;s immortal classic &#8220;In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida&#8221; before drifting into lazy hazy 70s hard rock and veering into <strong>Sabbath</strong> and <strong>Ghost</strong> territories. It&#8217;s a sprawling, unhurried saga that takes as much time as it wants to set the mood, with side quests into trippy guitar noodling. Surprisingly, it all works very well and the minutes fly by before you realize it. A very cool tune.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The back half of <em>The Poison Touch</em> is less adventurous, opting for more direct stoner rock attacks, but they generally hit pay dirt. &#8220;Holy Guide&#8221; reminds of <strong>Freedom Hawk</strong> and <strong>Uncle Acid</strong>, and closer &#8220;29th Scroll, 6th Verse&#8221; goes hard on the same kind of fuzzy bounce and groove <strong>Uncle Acid</strong> made their name with. The band&#8217;s agile songcraft makes things entertaining and memorable and they bring real chops to the execution, especially in the fretboard department. While no track feels completely unworthy, short interlude &#8220;Mourning Devils&#8221; doesn&#8217;t add much, and &#8220;Rat Bastard&#8221; is a bit too goofy, though the riffs are there in abundance. At a trim 36 minutes, the album flows past in a flash,  and even &#8220;Spell Speaker&#8221; doesn&#8217;t interrupt the rocking momentum.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-212373 aligncenter" src="https://www.angrymetalguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Warlung_The-Poison-Touch-02-500x375.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" srcset="https://www.angrymetalguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Warlung_The-Poison-Touch-02-500x375.jpg 500w, https://www.angrymetalguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Warlung_The-Poison-Touch-02-350x263.jpg 350w, https://www.angrymetalguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Warlung_The-Poison-Touch-02-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.angrymetalguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Warlung_The-Poison-Touch-02.jpg 800w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 48em) 100vw, 250px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Baba and Bennett share axe work as well as vocal duties and they do a fine job on both fronts. The guitar tandem loads the material with sharp riffs of various eras and styles and it&#8217;s a pleasure to hear them playing off one another as they move from hard-charging riffs to 70s psych rock, doom, and bong-fueled noodle sessions. They borrow from all the right sources and keep things interesting most of the time. The vocals are good too, vibrant and quirky, sometimes sounding a lot like Papa Emeritus. There&#8217;s a playfulness to them that works well with the music and throughout the album Baba and Bennett remind me of roughly 10 other stoner and doom vocalists, so variety is not an issue here.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Warlung</strong> bring a sense of joy and just enough inventiveness to the stoner/retro rock genre to make a lasting impression and what they do on <em>The Poison Touch</em> is mighty tough to dislike. It&#8217;s the kind of album that grows on you with every spin and there are some slick, killer tunes camping out here. I almost gave it a higher score and I&#8217;m enjoying it enough to start examining their back catalog, so they&#8217;re doing something right. If you need a fun, mindless palate cleanser of an album that pairs well with beers, buds, and other buds, catch yourself a nasty case of <strong>Warlung</strong>. Cough, cough, cough, cough DA-DA, DA-DA-DA!</p>

Boasting a nasty streak and series of ginormous grooves and infectiously hooky riffs and songwriting, the album had a fresh appeal, featuring nods towards legendary acts, <strong>Motörhead</strong> and<strong> Melvins.</strong> An equally impressive sophomore album followed, solidifying <strong>Mantar</strong> as a dependable force as their career progressed. Despite recent efforts not quite hitting the impressive highs of their early work,  <strong>Mantar</strong> remain true to the old &#8216;if it ain&#8217;t broke don&#8217;t fix it&#8217; motto to solid effect. Returning with a fifth album of original material, can <em>Post Apocalyptic Depression</em> find <strong>Mantar</strong> raising the takes to return to the intense highs of their early work, or will they fall victim to the dreaded <em>Law of Diminishing</em> returns?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Mantar</strong>&#8217;s signature sound remains distinctive and easy to like. The duo&#8217;s more refined songwriting and polished modern production may have slightly compromised the nastier edge and rawer traits that proved so effective on <em>Death By Burning</em> and <em>Ode to the Flame</em>, however, the duo&#8217;s sound has certainly not lost its edge.  Each song packs revved-up energy, punky attitude, and ample heft to get the blood pumping and the head bobbing in unison with <strong>Mantar</strong>&#8217;s groovy swagger and penchant for burly, surly riffs and hooky songcraft. In this respect <strong>Mantar</strong> treads similar terrain to their past couple of albums, pumping out compact, energetic ditties at a lively clip. Whereas the first couple of albums featured a darker, brooding menace and venomous edge, <em>Post Apocalyptic Depression</em> leans into the hard-hitting rock grooves and straightforward songwriting to warm, comforting, if less potent effect.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The raucous delivery and no-frills blueprint pay dividends for the most part, making for a punchy, compact listen. While mostly sticking to his trademark raspy snarl, Hanno&#8217;s endearing vocals possess a wickedly infectious knack for sing-along vocal hooks and accessibility that belies the seething elements and blackened touches that still frame the <strong>Mantar</strong> sound. It&#8217;s especially cool when he layers things up with a cleaner, punky snarl to offset his signature rasp. A quick burst of feedback kicks off opener &#8220;Absolute Ghost,&#8221; leading headlong into a thumping beat and typically groovy punk-sludge riff. It&#8217;s a brisk, impactful beginning, setting the tone for what follows. Amidst nods to their punkier old school roots, <em>Post Apocalyptic Depression </em>doesn&#8217;t bust boundaries or challenge the duo&#8217;s best work. However, it proves a heavier and slightly less polished affair than its predecessor, with a thin layer of grime to dirty up otherwise sleek modern production values.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-212268 size-large" src="https://www.angrymetalguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Mantar-PostApocalypticDepression02-500x333.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="333" srcset="https://www.angrymetalguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Mantar-PostApocalypticDepression02-500x333.jpg 500w, https://www.angrymetalguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Mantar-PostApocalypticDepression02-350x233.jpg 350w, https://www.angrymetalguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Mantar-PostApocalypticDepression02-768x511.jpg 768w, https://www.angrymetalguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Mantar-PostApocalypticDepression02-1536x1022.jpg 1536w, https://www.angrymetalguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Mantar-PostApocalypticDepression02-2048x1363.jpg 2048w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 48em) 100vw, 250px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Running at a tight 35 minutes, quality mostly strikes a consistent standard. A handful of decent but less remarkable tunes (&#8220;Morbid Vocation,&#8221; &#8220;Principle of Command&#8221; and &#8220;Two Choices of Eternity&#8221;) sit alongside more memorable counterparts, including super catchy single &#8220;Rex Perverso,&#8221; and the more ambitious, seething throes of blackened sludge brawler, &#8220;Halsgericht.&#8221; Pacing occasionally stutters but never derails momentum thanks to other cut-above gems, such as the vicious punk tones and anthemic hooks of the excellent &#8220;Dogma Down,&#8221; and walloping one-two punch of &#8220;Pit of Guilt&#8221; and dubiously titled &#8220;Church of Suck.&#8221;  Later in the piece, listeners will be pleased by the uglier, genuinely blackened intensity of the rabid &#8220;Axe Death Scenario.&#8221; Hanno&#8217;s solid guitar work and punk-charged sludgy riffs still carry plenty of bite and heft. Melodic undertones and groovy textures provide some extra versatility and nuance to otherwise straight-ahead jams, further driven by Erinc&#8217;s powerhouse, no-nonsense rhythms and hard-hitting style. Production is less glossy than its predecessor but again lacks the unrefined sonic charms of their earlier material, further dulled by compressed mastering.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Over a decade removed from their punishing debut, <strong>Mantar</strong> continue delivering the dependable goods. And at this point, it&#8217;s hard to imagine them dropping a dud album anytime soon. All the key ingredients remain, the writing is as catchy as ever, and while impact may not match the might of their early work, the duo retains their fun, rollicking yet uncompromising style and infectious songcraft. On the flipside, things are getting a little too predictable over the past few albums, with the weaker, or stock standard tunes scattered amidst some genuinely top-shelf anthems compromising overall quality. Mileage will vary, but <strong>Mantar</strong>&#8217;s <em>Post Apocalyptic Depression</em> is another worthy and entertaining addition to the <strong>Mantar</strong> canon.</p>

I don&#8217;t have a horse in the &#8220;for better or worse&#8221; race, but any thrash, newe or olde, hits hard when it strikes true. A big part of that impact comes from the spirit of thrash at its core. An inherent political lean and a pointed, punk energy defines much of what makes thrash thrash—to oversimplify the scene—and also makes up a significant portion of its appeal. For Edinburgh&#8217;s <strong>Black Talon</strong>, that spirit thrives and that appeal remains intact, despite ten long years separating their upcoming <em>Scenes of Agony</em> from their unsung debut, <a href="https://blacktalonthrash.bandcamp.com/album/endless-realities" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Endless Realities</em></a>. With such a lengthy turnaround between albums, I&#8217;m interested to hear what <strong>Black Talon</strong> have to say in 2025.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you&#8217;ve heard <a href="https://www.angrymetalguy.com/havok-v-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Havok</strong></a> and <a href="https://www.angrymetalguy.com/municipal-waste-slime-and-punishment-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Municipal Waste</strong></a>, you possess a decent frame of reference for <strong>Black Talon</strong>&#8217;s sound. Throw in the particularly energetic wiles of <a href="https://www.angrymetalguy.com/death-angel-humanicide-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Death Angel</strong></a> and their ilk, and a greater sense of familiarity with this material manifests. Politics and current events remain <strong>Black Talon</strong>&#8217;s subject of choice. To that end, earnest, if wholly unsubtle, lyrics deliver their message of frustration and disdain for various modern-age issues sneering from Johnny Steele&#8217;s versatile and venomous throat. Guitarist Rory Strachan stuffs an intimidating number of high-octane riffs, pulling from all corners of the thrashverse, into these forty-seven minutes, while drummer Dave Taylor pummels D-beats, freakouts, and double-bass runs—among other neat tricks—with wild abandon. Plucky and audible, bassist Eddie Campbell allots a delightful measure of low-end bounce to <em>Scenes of Agony</em>, giving the record a fuller heft than many modern records of this ilk can claim.</p>
<p><iframe class="aligncenter" style="border: 0; width: 500px; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2122509592/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless=""><a href="https://blacktalonthrash.bandcamp.com/album/scenes-of-agony"><em>Scenes of Agony</em> by <strong>Black Talon</strong></a></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The style they play may be well-worn and reliable, but <strong>Black Talon</strong>&#8217;s execution on <em>Scenes of Agony</em> is rock-solid and at least a cut above stock. No matter where you look, a ridiculously effective hook lurks right around the corner. One of my favorite examples, &#8220;Falsifier&#8221; offers choice vocal nuggets such as &#8220;STAGES OF DENIAL AT YOUR DISCRETION,&#8221; bouncy riffing and a deeply satisfying double bass run to seal the song permanently inside my hippocampus. Quick and vicious cuts &#8220;Scenes of Agony,&#8221; &#8220;Cryptocracy,&#8221; and &#8220;Killing Time&#8221; offer similar sticky moments that make it easy to pick them out of a lineup without checking the tracklist. Unexpectedly, long-form troublemakers &#8220;Isolation&#8221; and &#8220;The Bastard Gene&#8221; also stand out as highlights by virtue of sheer vivacity. Even factoring in their somewhat lengthy buildups, these songs shrink before my ears so radically that I would never guess &#8220;Isolation&#8221; ran over nine minutes and &#8220;The Bastard Gene&#8221; barely under eight. To achieve this result, these numbers exhibit strong motifs of similar sharpness to their leaner companions, a high level of instrumental detail, and dynamic momentum.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-210536 aligncenter" src="https://www.angrymetalguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/BlackTalon_ScenesOfAgony_02-500x334.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="334" srcset="https://www.angrymetalguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/BlackTalon_ScenesOfAgony_02-500x334.jpg 500w, https://www.angrymetalguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/BlackTalon_ScenesOfAgony_02-350x234.jpg 350w, https://www.angrymetalguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/BlackTalon_ScenesOfAgony_02-768x513.jpg 768w, https://www.angrymetalguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/BlackTalon_ScenesOfAgony_02-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://www.angrymetalguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/BlackTalon_ScenesOfAgony_02.jpg 2048w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 48em) 100vw, 250px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Meanwhile, other sections of <em>Scenes of Agony</em> struggle to clear the high bar <strong>Black Talon</strong> set with their strongest material. Obviously, ten years of marinating time permitted even these cuts to make some marks, but offerings such as &#8220;Obnoxion&#8221; and closer &#8220;Not Meant to Last&#8221; don&#8217;t have the same staying power as others. In the former example, I struggle to grasp what the underlying message its lyrics mean to express. While it might be just a comprehension failure on my part (very likely), this confusion takes me out of the musical experience, as does the disorienting rapid fade that rudely shuts the number down. &#8220;Not Meant to Last,&#8221; on the flipside, simply lacks strong characteristics to magnify its voice in the greater crowd of engaging material preceding it, save for a very nice guitar solo. As a result, it sends <em>Scenes of Agony</em> off on a weaker note than it deserved. As an additional note, while I appreciate <strong>Black Talon</strong>&#8217;s focus on excellent riffcraft and muscular songwriting, developing fiery solo work, like that on &#8220;The Bastard Gene&#8221; and &#8220;Not Meant to Last,&#8221; into a few more nooks and crannies might&#8217;ve offered complementary points interest to an already compelling work.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It bears mentioning that <em>Scenes of Agony</em> sounds great regardless of its songwriting strengths and weaknesses. Full tones, rich textures, and a nice balance between instruments with Johnny&#8217;s vocals placed appropriately in front, this production strikes the right chord with this sponge. In effect, that&#8217;s what pushes <em>Scenes of Agony</em> past Good and into Very Good territory. It&#8217;s clear <strong>Black Talon</strong> loved making this record, and that care and passion for the craft comes through in the final product. A couple of nicks here and there aren&#8217;t nearly enough to dull the ear-catching luster of what might be one of the better modern thrash records to come out this year. Only time will tell!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>"<b>Novarupta</b>'s <i>Astral Sands</i> is the fourth and final part of a tetralogy based on the elements fire, water, air, and earth. Covering the 'earth' part of that equation, <i>Astral Sands</i> follows 'air,' which came in the form of 2022's <i>Carrion Movements</i>. A departure from previous outings, that album was an instrumental piece, comprising just two sprawling compositions but was executed so well that I couldn't help but award it a 4.0. <i>Astral Sands</i> sees <b>Novarupta</b> not only reintroduce the vocals but return to the model seen on the series' first two installments, <i>Disillusioned Fire</i> and <i>Marine Snow</i>, respectively, working with a different vocalist for each track on the album." Metal bending.</p>

Covering the &#8216;earth&#8217; part of that equation, <em>Astral Sands</em> follows &#8216;air,&#8217; which came in the form of 2022&#8217;s <em>Carrion Movements</em>. A departure from previous outings, that album was an instrumental piece, comprising just two sprawling compositions but was executed so well that I couldn&#8217;t help but award it a 4.0. <em>Astral Sands</em> sees <strong>Novarupta</strong> not only reintroduce the vocals but return to the model seen on the series&#8217; first two installments, <em>Disillusioned Fire</em> and <em>Marine Snow</em>, respectively, working with a different vocalist for each track on the album. Despite this choice having the potential to sap cohesion, to date <strong>Novarupta</strong> has somehow made it work. Can the band see out its ambitious series on a high?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Compared to the ethereal grandeur and restraint of <em>Carrion Movements</em>, there is an instant sense of presence and immediacy to <em>Astral Sands</em> from the off, even on instrumental intro &#8220;Ensamstående: Enastående.&#8221; The whole record has a heavily distorted sound, that borders on sludge in the atmosphere it generates, without actually delivering sludge in the music (opening of &#8220;Seven Collides&#8221; or the back half of &#8220;Terraforming Celestial Bodies,&#8221; for example). In that sense, there&#8217;s something of <strong>Bossk</strong>&#8217;s <em>Migration</em> about it. Paired with upbeat drumming that borders on d-beat in places (closer &#8220;Now We are Here (at the Inevitable End)&#8221; or &#8220;The Clay Keeps&#8221;), <strong>Novarupta</strong> has a propulsive energy throughout that is at odds with much of their previous output, which is often ponderous and slow build. Even as <strong>Novarupta</strong> descend into morose trad doom a la <strong>Tiamat</strong> (&#8220;Breathe Breathe,&#8221; with vocals from Patrik Wirén of <strong>Misery Loves Co.</strong>) there&#8217;s a shimmering lightness to the guitars, enhanced by the synths, which slide from left to right and back again in the mix, that keeps the whole surprisingly vibrant.</p>
<p><iframe class="aligncenter" style="border: 0; width: 500px; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3675809194/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless=""><a href="https://suiciderecordsswe.bandcamp.com/album/astral-sands"><em>Astral Sands</em> by <strong>Novarupta</strong></a></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Inevitably, with an album that changes vocalist on eight of its nine tracks (with one instrumental number), your enjoyment of <em>Astral Sands</em> will vary somewhat track by track, according to whose voice you like best. The indisputable highlight of the piece—at least for me and it&#8217;s my review, so it&#8217;s indisputable for present purposes—is closer, &#8220;Now We are Here (at the Inevitable End),&#8221; which finds Martin Wegeland of <strong>Domkraft</strong> on mic duties. Initially airy, vulnerable, and breathy in his delivery, by the end of the track and, therefore, the album, Wegeland hits the sort of manic intensity and urgency that I look for in the likes of <strong>Julie Christmas</strong>. Other standouts include the almost poppy &#8220;Endless Joy&#8221; and &#8220;Terraforming Celestial Bodies,&#8221; with the latter (featuring <strong>Greanleaf</strong>&#8217;s Arvid Hällagård on vox) nodding towards <strong>The Cure</strong>.<sup class='footnote'><a href='https://www.angrymetalguy.com/novarupta-astral-sands-review/#fn-212289-1' id='fnref-212289-1' onclick='return fdfootnote_show(212289)'>1</a></sup></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-210374 size-large" src="https://www.angrymetalguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Novarupta-Astral-Sands-02-500x500.jpeg" alt="" width="500" height="500" srcset="https://www.angrymetalguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Novarupta-Astral-Sands-02-500x500.jpeg 500w, https://www.angrymetalguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Novarupta-Astral-Sands-02-350x350.jpeg 350w, https://www.angrymetalguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Novarupta-Astral-Sands-02-150x150.jpeg 150w, https://www.angrymetalguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Novarupta-Astral-Sands-02-768x768.jpeg 768w, https://www.angrymetalguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Novarupta-Astral-Sands-02-1536x1536.jpeg 1536w, https://www.angrymetalguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Novarupta-Astral-Sands-02.jpeg 2048w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 48em) 100vw, 250px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Throughout the shifts in pacing and mood on <em>Astral Sands</em>, driven principally by the ever-changing vocal line-up, there&#8217;s a consistency in the sound, which knits together <strong>Novarupta</strong>&#8217;s songwriting. Whether it&#8217;s the lush post-metal guitars and bass groove (&#8220;Cosmographia&#8221;), or the spangly, fizzing synths, there&#8217;s a through line to the record that holds it together. It also helps that the various singers adopt a broadly comparable approach, with no harsh vocals on show and most taking a slightly distant, almost 80s-synthwave approach to their delivery. The production throughout, presumably to deliver that earthy feel, leans heavily into fuzz and distortion at the front of the soundstage, even though there&#8217;s an almost crystalline quality to some of the soundscapes and melodies behind that.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To be honest, I had no idea what to expect from <em>Astral Sands</em>. I had been tipped off in advance that the vocals were back but had resolutely resisted listening to the singles. And I&#8217;ll admit I was nervous. While I enjoyed <em>Marine Snow</em>, for me the highlight of <strong>Novarupta</strong>&#8217;s catalogue was <em>Carrion Movements</em>, where the abandonment of ever-shifting vocalists allowed mainmen Alex Stjernfeldt and Arjen Kunnen to focus on their compositions, which were huge in scope and delicately executed. On <em>Astral Sands</em>, the pair have reverted to their previous model, while learning from what they delivered on <em>Carrion Movements</em>. Although the album is structured as nine tracks, there is flow and a sense of grandeur to it, which builds on <em>Carrion Movements</em>. Even the bookending of the album, with reflected similarities between the start of sonorous opener &#8220;Ensamstående: Enastående&#8221; and more intense closer &#8220;Now We are Here (at the Inevitable End),&#8221; highlights this. More than a worthy closing movement in <strong>Novarupta</strong>&#8217;s tetralogy, <em>Astral Sands</em> is the pick of the series.</p>

Though the path of increasing hippitude often appeals to aging, progressive musical minds—think the <strong>Cynic</strong>s and <strong>Devin Townsend</strong>s of this world—<strong>Obscura</strong> has emerged from <a href="https://www.angrymetalguy.com/obscura-omnivium-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a snaking</a> and <a href="https://www.angrymetalguy.com/obscura-akroasis-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deeply-arranged</a> past into a nature barbed with Björriffed hooks and piercing, melodic peaks. Of course, a path, however traveled it may be, can always reveal a new wrinkle in weathered hands.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>A Sonication</em> functions as a step further into the synthesis of melodeath&#8217;s formative sounds with the steadfast <strong>Obscura</strong> amalgam. Kummerer has framed <strong>Obscura</strong> throughout each iteration as an exploration of his love for death metal, leaning on the percussiveness of <strong>Cynic</strong>-indebted guitar lines for rhythmic propulsion or the heft of a <strong>Morbid Angel</strong> syncopated, violent groove to shatter the typically bright, techy flow.<sup class='footnote'><a href='https://www.angrymetalguy.com/obscura-a-sonication-review/#fn-212196-2' id='fnref-212196-2' onclick='return fdfootnote_show(212196)'>2</a></sup> And as the earlier, longer-form progressive leanings swelled and passed, <strong>Obscura</strong> extracted from punchier sources a scrappier stance and lower-sweep attitude. That&#8217;s not to say that neither Kummerer nor new hire Kevin Olasz (<strong>Crone</strong>, <strong>God Enslavement</strong>) ignore their virtuosity entirely, letting vibrant and buttery leads and solos guide the path of spacious riffs on several occasions. But <em>A Sonication</em>&#8217;s compositions sway through scales with a tight tether to the growing sadness in Kummerer&#8217;s shrieky and modulated cries.</p>
<p><iframe class="aligncenter" style="border: 0; width: 500px; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3651182611/size=large/bgcol=333333/linkcol=9a64ff/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless=""><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span><a href="https://obscura.bandcamp.com/album/a-sonication">A Sonication by Obscura</a></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Seven albums in, <strong>Obscura</strong> doesn&#8217;t aim to surprise so much as they aim to wear their strengths well. Through thundering tom booms and frayed guitar cuts that veteran producer <a href="https://www.metal-archives.com/artists/Fredrik_Nordstr%C3%B6m/7732" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fredrik Nordström</a> helps boost and divide for bubbling bass delicacies, <em>A Sonication</em> achieves a scratchy yet clear sonic identity that grants it a defined stance amongst its preceding incarnations. Raging opener &#8220;Silver Linings&#8221; and spiritual follow-up &#8220;In Solitude&#8221; capture the same <strong>At the Gates</strong> on bass-loaded poppers melotech swirl that helped 2021&#8217;s <a href="https://www.angrymetalguy.com/obscura-a-valediction-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>A Valediction</em></a> find a power-swagger in resuscitated Gothenburg licks. And in a syncopated heroic riff pattern that recurs that peppers itself from open to close—a pattern that too litters the <strong>Obscura</strong> discog, from &#8220;Noospheres&#8221; (<em>Cosmogenesis</em>, 2009) to &#8220;Akróasis&#8221; (<em>Akróasis</em>, 2015) to &#8220;Emergent Evolution&#8221; (<em>Diluvium</em>, 2018)—<em>A Sonication</em> finds a familiar and invigorating harmonic grounding for the pummeling rhythms and throat-mangling rasps that surround.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, <em>A Sonication</em> loses steam at the hands of piecework pacing amongst its self-referential hooks. <b>Obscura</b> has chosen this release to be their shortest to date, often a signal for experience-dialed intrigue and charm. But in paradox, cuts like &#8220;Evenfall&#8221; kill the early ripping mood with a sadboi-coded, anthemic lurch, despite <strong>Obscura</strong> still trying to navigate up front with quick-sticking riffs. Easy enjoyment finds a further sputter both in bursts of speed that feel like part of a different album (&#8220;The Prolonging&#8221;) and a reprisal instrumental track (&#8220;Beyond the Seventh Sun&#8221;), the latter of which, in its high-tech nature, has been an <strong>Obscura</strong> staple (&#8220;Orbital Elements&#8221; of <em>Cosmogenesis</em> and &#8220;Orbital Elements II&#8221; of <em>A Valediction</em> being the direct pedigree). Both that whiplash <strong>Necrophagist</strong> intensity followed by an in-the-lines obligation fill space in a way that doesn&#8217;t service the dark, harmony-seeking themes of the album—detours for the sake of fulfilling traditional aggression and wankery. In contrast, &#8220;Stardust&#8221; unpacking the finishing trio, no matter how many times we&#8217;ve heard a variation on that main riff,<sup class='footnote'><a href='https://www.angrymetalguy.com/obscura-a-sonication-review/#fn-212196-3' id='fnref-212196-3' onclick='return fdfootnote_show(212196)'>3</a></sup> delivers on the melodic melancholy that gives <em>A Sonication</em> its grayscale character.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As the enmelodeathification of <strong>Obscura</strong> continues through <em>A Sonication</em>, Kummerer has found a comfort in a focused and polished expression that pleases with little effort, even if it lacks novel and awe-inspiring moments. In that same way, <strong>Obscura</strong>&#8217;s trajectory mirrors the patterns of crystallization that have occurred in the melosphere at large, with a streamlining of attack that errs close to a sanding of its unique aspects. <strong>Obscura</strong> retains a core of digestible and attachable showmanship carried by death-loving riffage, which makes its missteps quizzical in its supposed three-year construction. But <em>A Sonication</em> succeeds enough anyway—not with the blossoming strength of wisdom but with a persistence too practiced to craft a bad product.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The comparator bands are reasonably appropriate. <strong>Mad Parish</strong>’s music falls somewhere in the blurred lines between 70s hard rock, 80s heavy metal, and prog rock. It prioritizes guitar and vocal melodies, but features plenty of synths and has conceptual aspirations supported by the story-telling interludes and a comic. The guitars play some solid riffs but these are typically limited to introductions; by the time they reach the verses and choruses, they’re more forgettable. For example, “An Age of Quell” opens with proper energy and weaves its guitars with synths in a <strong>Yes</strong>-sy fashion. But the ensuing verse lead can’t match the energy and invention of the introduction. Likewise, the first riff on “Cathedron Wakes” bridges technicality with melody and later bleeds into a crisp groove. But these cool leads are ruined with computerized vocals as the song develops. Hampering the core music the most is the production. The prominent synths undercut any guitar crunch, while the vocals can be over-produced and the drums lack punch through their weak bass presence. I like the leads a lot better when they’re exposed without the synths which stray into silly far too often. <em>Dust of Forever</em> is substantially rock music, but it doesn’t always <em>feel</em> like it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I also struggle with the sometimes unclear songwriting signposts. Songs like “Possess the Child” careen from melody to melody with little indication that you’ve moved from verse to bridge to chorus. Of course, it’s possible to pick these out if you’re listening closely but without strong melodies, it feels directionless. And while this song improves in the second half, its instrumental passage might as well not belong to this song at all because it’s melodically inconsistent with the remainder. This trait extends across the album. In particular, the ten story-telling interludes are unnecessarily distinct from the main songs. The flute on “Outerest in Irisius” is just as odd as the horns on “Hunted.” Worse are the first two “Transmission” tracks that feature intriguing snippets of music from other genres – happy folk rock and jazzy swing – but are nonetheless superfluous and strange. They don’t improve the overall quality or flow, and these interludes add 15 minutes to an album that already feels too long.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-210449 size-large" src="https://www.angrymetalguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/876194-500x319.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="319" srcset="https://www.angrymetalguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/876194-500x319.jpg 500w, https://www.angrymetalguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/876194-350x223.jpg 350w, https://www.angrymetalguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/876194-768x490.jpg 768w, https://www.angrymetalguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/876194-1536x979.jpg 1536w, https://www.angrymetalguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/876194-2048x1306.jpg 2048w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 48em) 100vw, 250px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All this endorses the position that <em>Dust of Forever</em> lacks a musical sense of direction. Given that it has a concept and supporting comic, you would expect that it would at least trace a discernible route through its many songs and interludes. But this isn’t the case, and there’s no sense of climax towards the end of the album. The last main song is just another song enclosed by weird short tracks. Across an album this long, I at least want some sense of payoff but there’s none. However, the most damning quality of <em>Dust of Forever</em> is that even if it only ran for 30 minutes, it would still feel repetitive and dull. I struggle to get through just a ten-minute stint without my attention wandering elsewhere, let alone all 71 minutes. Spreading material that lazily sways from sub-par to mediocre over such a long period results in a record that proactively saps my energy and enthusiasm.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While <strong>Mad Parish</strong> may stylistically fit between the bands that form their core influences, the quality here falls far short. <em>Dust of Forever</em> lacks the infectious energy of <strong>Iron Maiden</strong>, the progressive levity of <strong>Camel</strong>, the technical grandeur of <strong>Rush,</strong> and the groovy boldness of <strong>Rainbow</strong>. This album isn’t totally devoid of value, but the choice fragments are buried in a deluge of other material that I cannot approve of. Picking out the positives involves cherry-picking specific guitar or vocal melodies from specific songs. This is possible but it wouldn’t tell you much about the overall quality or key characteristics of the album. Hopefully, the remainder of this review has done so.</p>

The duo&#8217;s experience working on <strong>Black Sun Aeon</strong> paid dividends and together they created a rich, engrossing, highly memorable slab of melancholic doom/death dripping with Finnish sadboi glory. <em>Waves</em> ended up my <a href="https://www.angrymetalguy.com/steel-druhms-top-tenish-of-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Record o&#8217; the Year for 2020</a> and I still break it out when winter winds begin to blow. 2022s <em>Flames of Perdition</em> was a worthy follow-up though it couldn&#8217;t quite reach the same lofty heights as its predecessor. <em>Affliction Vortex</em> is the third collaboration between Toumas and Mikko under the <strong>Dawn of Solace</strong> banner and wisely, they haven&#8217;t tweaked the formula much. It&#8217;s still uber-glum melo-doom designed for a cold winter&#8217;s night introspection and all the key elements are in place. But can it hope to rival the maudlin majesty of <em>Waves</em>?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Not a chance, but it&#8217;s hard to resist what Tuomas and Mikko brew up nonetheless. Tuomas has proven himself a master craftsman when it comes to weepy, despondent guitar work and sullen writing, and he&#8217;s lost none of his edge. When paired with Mikko&#8217;s smooth but pained vocals, good things are bound to happen. First proper track &#8220;Murder&#8221; is a classic <strong>Dawn of Solace</strong> composition, weighed down with forlorn guitar lines and carried expertly by Mikko&#8217;s despondent crooning. It&#8217;s exactly the kind of song you expect and desire from the duo and it doesn&#8217;t disappoint. This would have sat well on <em>Waves</em>, and no further compliments need be paid. &#8220;Fortress&#8221; begins life sounding like something off <strong>Katatonia</strong>&#8217;s <em>Viva Emptiness</em> with tense, <del>angular</del> riffs, before Tuomas comes in with weighty death bellows and trilling harmonies that take things back to Finnish environs. &#8220;Into the Light&#8221; sounds like an old <strong>Black Sun Aeon</strong> song dug up and reworked, and I&#8217;m predestined to like it due to the downcast riffs and Finnish graveyard aesthetic. Tuomas delivers icy black rasps for extra chills and all is well.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The album crests with &#8220;Rival&#8221; &#8211; one of the best songs to come out of the Tuomas/Mikko collaboration, which is saying something. Mikko stretches himself vocally, providing an emotive journey that climaxes with a stellar chorus that hits just right. It&#8217;s sullen but vibrant and I can&#8217;t get enough of it. &#8220;Dream&#8221; is another stone-cold killer, leveraging Mikko&#8217;s vocal talents for maximum payoff as Tuomas roars in the background. Shades of <strong>Rapture</strong> live large in this one, but it&#8217;s undeniably a Tuomas joint. Some songs like &#8220;Invitation&#8221; recycle the sounds of <strong>Before the Dawn</strong> and <strong>Black Sun Aeon</strong> more than others, but it&#8217;s done toward good ends. &#8220;Perennial&#8221; is an interesting cut, slower, heavier and more dependent on Tuomas&#8217; death grunts while Mikko alters his delivery toward something more rock-based. It stands out and almost feels out of place, but it works. At a tight 39 minutes, there&#8217;s no unsightly padding and only one track breaks the 4-minute barrier. This makes for a brisk, engaging spin with a solid replay factor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-212319 aligncenter" src="https://www.angrymetalguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Dawn-of-Solace_Affliction-Vortex-02-500x269.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="269" srcset="https://www.angrymetalguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Dawn-of-Solace_Affliction-Vortex-02-500x269.jpg 500w, https://www.angrymetalguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Dawn-of-Solace_Affliction-Vortex-02-350x188.jpg 350w, https://www.angrymetalguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Dawn-of-Solace_Affliction-Vortex-02-768x413.jpg 768w, https://www.angrymetalguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Dawn-of-Solace_Affliction-Vortex-02.jpg 1500w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 48em) 100vw, 250px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What more can be said of the talents of this duo? Tuomas has proven his worth on countless albums spanning multiple genres and he continues to find inspiration in the darker side of life and the human psyche. He excels at crafting depressive doom and his riffcraft is always high quality. There are many of his cold, fragile, and morose leads here and plenty of his Gothy trilling and harmonizing too. His death roars and blackened rasps are good as always, injecting extremity into the melancholy while adding an effective counterpoint to Mikko&#8217;s disconsolate singing. Speaking of which, Mikko is always a slam dunk when it comes to this kind of music. He&#8217;s the prototype of a Goth metal singer and his voice is perfectly suited to the dejected songcraft. This is one of those pairings you can count on to deliver, and they do it again here.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I doubt <strong>Dawn of Solace</strong> will ever top what they accomplished on <em>Waves</em>, but three albums into the Mikko era, they&#8217;ve done nothing but deliver high quality output. <em>Affliction Vortex</em> is more or less equal to <em>Flames of Perdition</em> with major highs and no duds. They&#8217;ve found a sweet spot in the sadboi doom genre and I hope they continue to mine it for more gems. I&#8217;ll keep buying until they hit the unruly Balrog.</p>

It remains a staple in my rotation even now, thanks to hypnotic blends of dour atmosphere and poppy hooks sharp enough to pierce the gray matter permanently. This disparate combination is what put <strong>Lacuna Coil</strong> on the map as a common gateway for new metal fans. It also serves as a nostalgic portal for established metalheads like myself, who to this day kneel in reverence at the altar of those groups who lowered us, ever so lovingly, into the hellish arms of the underground and the extreme.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Lacuna Coil</strong>&#8217;s history, unlike some other bands of significance, is fraught with inconsistency packaged into three distinct eras. The first, a moody, doom-laden run that introduced the group to the world, culminating in the legendary <em>Comalies</em>. With <em>Karmacode</em>, <strong>Lacuna Coil</strong> modernized their approach, pulling inspiration from trendy metal tropes of the mid-2000s mainstream and dispensed with their half-doom half-goth personality (check the <strong>Korn</strong>-y bass tone on <em>Karmacode</em> and the hard rock attitude of<a href="https://www.angrymetalguy.com/lacuna-coil-dark-adrenaline-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em> Dark Adrenaline</em></a>). This persisted for the next eight years, all the way through the darker, but shaky misfire <a href="https://www.angrymetalguy.com/lacuna-coil-broken-crown-halo-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Broken Crown Halo</em></a>. A resurgence and return to form shortly thereafter manifested <strong>Lacuna Coil</strong>&#8217;s current shape on <em>Delirium</em>. Fresh and energetic, <strong>Lacuna Coil</strong>&#8217;s latest sound maximized its impact with the awesome <a href="https://www.angrymetalguy.com/lacuna-coil-black-anima-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Black Anima</em></a>, striking a compelling balance between the groove-laden swagger of their mid-period and the genuine gothic heft of their origins. Earnest beyond expectation, <em>Black Anima</em> set a new standard for <strong>Lacuna Coil</strong> and deeply informs their upcoming tenth<sup class='footnote'><a href='https://www.angrymetalguy.com/lacuna-coil-sleepless-empire-review/#fn-212206-1' id='fnref-212206-1' onclick='return fdfootnote_show(212206)'>1</a></sup> record, <em>Sleepless Empire</em>.</p>
<p><iframe class="aligncenter" style="border: 0; width: 500px; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1846707559/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless=""><a href="https://centurymedia.bandcamp.com/album/sleepless-empire-24-bit-hd-audio"><em>Sleepless Empire</em> (24-bit HD audio) by <strong>Lacuna Coil</strong></a></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Throughout all of this tumultuous history, the shining beacon leading the way to success was Cristina Scabbia and her venomous, unmistakable siren song. Hemorrhaging power and charisma, Scabbia elevates everything, and that remains true here. To listen to the anomalous &#8220;I Wish You Were Dead&#8221; threatens to derail the entire experience, as the song itself recalls the bulk of their largely unloved (outside of the mainstream) radio-rock mid-period—but Scabbia&#8217;s spine-twisting snarl inevitably twists my conflicted mind towards the positive. Elsewhere, stronger cuts &#8220;Oxygen,&#8221; &#8220;Scarecrow,&#8221; &#8220;Sleepless Empire,&#8221; and &#8220;Sleep Paralysis&#8221; more faithfully reproduce the fiery swing and sticky pull of <em>Delirium</em>&#8217;s and <em>Black Anima</em>&#8217;s material, once again showcasing Scabbia&#8217;s brilliant placement and diverse range. These cuts make great use of Andrea Ferro&#8217;s vicious screams, highly reminiscent of <a href="https://www.angrymetalguy.com/lamb-of-god-lamb-of-god-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Lamb of God</strong></a>&#8216;s Randy Blythe (who himself features on the decent, but not quite excellent, &#8220;Hosting the Shadow&#8221;), as well. In fact, Ferro—for perhaps the first time in the band&#8217;s history—acquits himself with aplomb on <em>Sleepless Empire</em>. By completely abandoning his much-maligned rough-hewn cleans in favor of an extra heavy dose of throat-shredding roars, Ferro finally answers a decades-long call for a necessary shift even die-hard <strong>Lacuna Coil</strong> fans demanded. To see it finally executed instills a blazing fire of vindication and a soothing wave of relief.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Meanwhile, longtime keyboardist Marco Coti Zelati takes over for Diego &#8220;DD&#8221; Cavallotti on guitars on top of his synth duties, resulting in a bit of a mixed bag on the instrumental front. &#8220;DD&#8221; earned his stripes by injecting <strong>Lacuna Coil</strong>&#8217;s <em>Black Anima</em> material with everything it needed to resonate with skeptics and fans alike, who both longed for more impactful guitar work from these Italians (see &#8220;Reckless,&#8221; &#8220;Veneficium,&#8221; and &#8220;Under the Surface&#8221;). Zelati does everything in his talented fingers to recreate the same results in his voice but falls short. Many of <em>Sleepless Empire</em>&#8217;s riffs and motifs lack punch (&#8220;In Nomine Patris&#8221;), engage in stale, chugging repetition (&#8220;The Siege,&#8221; &#8220;Sleepless Empire,&#8221; &#8220;Never Dawn&#8221;), or pull too heavily from <strong>Lacuna Coil</strong>&#8217;s past without doing enough to train them up for duty today (&#8220;Gravity,&#8221; &#8220;In the Mean Time&#8221;). Thankfully, the rhythm section makes up some of the slack, with former <a href="https://www.angrymetalguy.com/genus-ordinis-dei-great-olden-dynasty-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Genus Ordinis Dei</strong></a> drummer Richard Meiz taking the skins in his confident hands just as he did on <em>Black Anima</em>. As a final note, <em>Sleepless Empire</em>&#8217;s production is a notable step down. Inexplicably muddy and loud at the same time, it crushes everything to paper-thin flatness, save for the way-up-front vocals.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At the end of the day, I can&#8217;t say I&#8217;m disappointed with <em>Sleepless Empire</em>. There was little chance of it eclipsing <strong>Lacuna Coil</strong>&#8217;s landmark records. However, if my instincts are correct about how <strong>Lacuna Coil</strong> evolves—and I believe that they are—I suspect we&#8217;re simply witnessing the dying breaths of their current sound. Unfortunately, <em>Sleepless Empire</em> isn&#8217;t the explosive send-off it should&#8217;ve been to once more careen <strong>Lacuna Coil</strong> headfirst into new territory. Yet, I find myself charmed even still, such that I remain fascinated by what their future might hold.</p>

Artists at all levels that we cover here at Angry Metal Guy HQ, often, deliver their albums to the world for the love of the game—not the glitz or glory. <strong>Negative 13</strong>, as a collective of friends, reignited their passion for the game to release 2022&#8217;s long-awaited <a href="https://www.angrymetalguy.com/negative-13-mourning-asteri-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Mourning Asteri</em></a>, a satisfying sludge platter full of punky energy and melancholy. And this time, only three years later, <em>Recover What You Can</em> arrives in a timely and timelessly snarling manner, ready to show again how friends who suffer together come out all the stronger.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It&#8217;s uncanny how textbook sludge <strong>Negative 13</strong> hits without sounding too similar to any one big name through <em>Recover</em>. In many ways, their older origins play some part in this differentiation, with the inspiration from their sound reaching back equally to proto-acts like riff-churned <em>Into the Pandemonium</em>-era <strong>Celtic Frost</strong><sup class='footnote'><a href='https://www.angrymetalguy.com/negative-13-recover-what-you-can-review/#fn-210338-1' id='fnref-210338-1' onclick='return fdfootnote_show(210338)'>1</a></sup> or early post-punky <strong>Swans</strong> as it does to NOLA groove flagbearers like <strong>Eyehategod</strong>. As such, as is necessary in well-weighted doom and sludge endeavors, <strong>Negative 13</strong> lives on the edge of amp-carved charges, finding life in a breadth of volume-driven and pedal-kissed tones. Without an abused guitar, a cranked amp, and a strained throat, <em>Recover What You Can</em> would not exist.</p>
<p><iframe class="aligncenter" style="border: 0; width: 500px; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=564105600/size=large/bgcol=333333/linkcol=2ebd35/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless=""><a href="https://negative13.bandcamp.com/album/recover-what-you-can">Recover What You Can by Negative 13</a></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Though <strong>Negative 13</strong> has chosen to keep <em>Recover</em>&#8217;s run lean, they&#8217;ve not forgotten to imbue every intro, verse, chorus, and space in between with the drag and hustle of furious riffage. An unfettered, surfy twang tramples through &#8220;The Vulture Circles&#8221; to kick off a punk-sneered ripper. A crushed and gated scrawl filters and folds into monstrous chords that back a creaky, impassioned bellow (&#8220;Horizon Divides&#8221;). And borrowing tactics from a faded <strong>The Jesus Lizard</strong> playbook, <strong>Negative 13</strong> twists the longest cuts here with hissing feedback, near panic-level stabs, and frothing mouth mic abuse to bring heavyweight builds to emotional conclusions. It&#8217;s that tie to the heart that allows familiar marches and lockstep sways to resonate beyond the impact of loudness. Fervent cries to &#8220;<em>pick yourself up and dust off your bones</em>&#8221; (&#8220;The Vulture Circles&#8221;) and plaintive confessions that &#8220;<em>I&#8217;ve been here before but it never plays out the same way</em>&#8221; carry an earnest pathos that sews buzzing refrains to time-worn sleeves.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-210340 size-large" src="https://www.angrymetalguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Negative-13-Recover-What-You-Can-02-500x347.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="347" srcset="https://www.angrymetalguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Negative-13-Recover-What-You-Can-02-500x347.jpg 500w, https://www.angrymetalguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Negative-13-Recover-What-You-Can-02-350x243.jpg 350w, https://www.angrymetalguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Negative-13-Recover-What-You-Can-02-768x533.jpg 768w, https://www.angrymetalguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Negative-13-Recover-What-You-Can-02.jpg 1080w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 48em) 100vw, 250px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Recover</em> suffers a strange fate at the hands of trim desires in that certain endings and transitions feel to be lacking that same tether that the songs hold within themselves. From the introductory &#8220;The Desolate&#8221; to quick burst &#8220;Casket Trail,&#8221; it&#8217;s not immediately apparent that the remainder of the album will skip along in a more disconnected manner as those two tracks function like a classic stage-hook blast. But starting with &#8220;The Vulture Circles&#8221; through to <em>Recover</em>&#8217;s close, we&#8217;re treated to an inconveniencing array of rapid-dissolve fade outs and awkward clips. An album closing with a hard stop can still have impact, but the kind of fuzzy cut that caps off the titular conclusion feels less like a swelling halt and more like turning a corner right into a wall. After repeated spins these kinds of minor stumbles settle into a strange, if learned, flow, reducing total grief. But I do wonder whether one additional shorter form jam could have pushed <em>Recover</em> across an even more satisfying line.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In its current state, however, <em>Recover What You Can</em> boasts a strong sludge performance that wields steadfast riff construction and heartfelt lyric expulsion in grooving balance. Born of a time after the genre&#8217;s inception and revived in a world far removed from its heyday, <strong>Negative 13</strong> has remained an act discovered by happenstance—the deep (very deep) dive of a <strong>Neurosis</strong>-awakened neophyte, the Pittsburgh local who has known about them since day one, or you, dear reader, who may have seen their last output covered in these halls. Whatever the case—a curious mind of unstudied or well-read discovery—those who know of <strong>Negative 13 </strong>and long for an efficient and affective blend of doom power and punk fury will once again reap the rewards of patient and intentional output. <em>Recover What You Can</em> is unlikely to pull in the non-believers. To them we simply ask to listen and enjoy what you can.</p>
